  tagline: "Resilience. That's the one word.",
  
  intro: `Jacob Kline—J-Kline—was born February 21, 1991, in Battle Creek, Michigan. Raised by a single mother who worked factory nights and attended nursing school during the day, he learned early what sacrifice looks like. What fighting for something looks like.`,
  
  origins: `His brother, 13 years older, became his gateway to hip-hop. Wu-Tang. Dr. Dre. Eminem. 2pac. By first grade, J-Kline told his teacher he wanted to be an actor. By sixth grade, he was a hip-hop head writing his own rhymes—finding words for feelings he couldn't speak. At 14, he stepped into a studio for the first time, and something clicked.`,
  
  darkness: `Then came the loss that would shape everything. At 11, J-Kline lost his father to addiction. The pain carved deep. By senior year in 2009, anxiety and depression had taken hold. He started using to cope—a temporary fix that became a nine-year sentence. Jails. Rehabs. Homelessness. Fentanyl. The cycle seemed unbreakable. In 2013, he moved to Austin hoping for a fresh start. It didn't work. Not yet.`,
  
  redemption: `April 2018: J-Kline got clean. After five years away from music, he picked up the pen again. He started building something real in Austin's hip-hop scene. Then March 2020 hit—pandemic, job gone. But the worst was coming. In June 2020, he lost his best friend in a tragic lake accident. The grief was unbearable. He relapsed.`,
  
  today: `October 2021: He got clean again. This time, he hasn't looked back.

J-Kline channeled everything—the pain, the loss, the lessons learned the hard way—into "Lost In Austin," his debut album released through College of Hip-Hop Knowledge Records and Sony-Orchard. Now he's working on "The Redemption Tape," his second album and most personal work yet.

But music is only part of the mission. As a certified life coach, motivational speaker, and recovery advocate, J-Kline uses his platform to reach those still struggling. Every bar he writes carries the weight of experience. Every word is proof that you can come back from anything.`,

  closing: `"My mission is to be a voice of hope, courage, and strength. That no matter what you're going through, you can make it out, you can bounce back, and it's never too late."

Everything he's been through is part of his story. And his story isn't finished yet.`
