export const shortBio = `J-Kline is an Austin, TX hip-hop artist, certified life coach, and recovery advocate. Through raw, vulnerable music, he shares his journey from addiction and homelessness to hope and redemption—proving it's never too late to turn your life around.`;

export const longBio = `Born February 21, 1991, in Battle Creek, Michigan, J-Kline (Jacob Kline) was raised by a single mother after losing his father to addiction at age 11. He started writing raps at 14 as an outlet for the pain he carried—never imagining where those words would take him.

For nine years, J-Kline battled addiction himself. The cycle of jails, rehabs, and homelessness seemed endless. In 2013, he moved to Austin, Texas, searching for a fresh start. After getting clean in April 2018, tragedy struck: he lost his best friend in June 2020, leading to a painful relapse.

But J-Kline's story doesn't end there. He got clean again in October 2021 and channeled everything—the pain, the hope, the hard-won lessons—into his debut album "Lost In Austin," released through Sony-Orchard in 2022.

Today, J-Kline is more than a hip-hop artist. As a certified life coach, motivational speaker, and recovery advocate, he uses his platform to reach those still struggling. His music isn't just entertainment—it's a lifeline. Every bar he writes carries the weight of experience and the light of redemption.

His mission is simple: to be a voice of hope, courage, and strength, proving that no matter what you're going through, you can make it out, you can bounce back, and it's never too late to turn your life around.`;
